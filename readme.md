Setup

in root: npm install 

mysql -u student -p   ?
in ./app.js: nodemon (from server folder)

we used npm install -save nodemon in the command line to populate the package.json dependencies so we don't need to reinstall nodemon and underscore every time we clone this repo. 


we will need to use create under Sessions class to generate a hash that we will store in our sessions table 

which one is baseurl and which one is url in links. 

HIR: why don't our tests work anymore? 

go to neancat site later

how to see the test logs

Who the heck is howard?

Is every user supposed to have their own list of sites, or do they all have access to the same sites because they are all members?
